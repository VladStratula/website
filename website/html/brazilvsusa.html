        <p>After the setback they had suffered in the opening set that ended for Brazil with the worst score ever since the introduction of the rally point system, only a few were keen to pick out the 2008 Olympic champions as the eventual winners of the gold medal at Earls Court. However, they eventually stormed back stepping up their quality and intensity to finally stop the American scoring machine and earned a well-deserved 3-1 win (11 	&ndash;25, 25 	&ndash;17, 25 	&ndash;20, and 25 	&ndash;17) to strike gold.</p>
        <p>Jaqueline Carvalho played her best game in London right by the moment it counted the most, totalling 18 points at the end of the match, with three more -- Sheilla Castro, Fabiana Claudino and Fernanda Rodrigues -- finishing in double figures.</p>
        <p>The American offense got somehow stuck after a brilliant first set with their best attacker, Destinee Hooker, being controlled by the Brazilian block and ending up by chipping in with 14 points.</p>
        <p>With Team USA settling for their third silver medal at the Olympics, this result expands Brazil's medal collection to four, with two gold and two bronze medals included in their unique showcase. Brazil joins the Soviet Union (1968 and 1972) and Cuba (that actually got three through 1992 	&ndash; 2000) as the only teams to win back-to-back Gold Medals in Women's Volleyball.
        <p>In a rematch of the 2008 Beijing Olympics final, Team USA rushed to a terrific start (5 	&ndash; 1) to assert their intention to go for their first Olympic gold in history, something that would cap a couple of memorable seasons where the current leaders of the world ranking had regularly imposed their rule in all major international competitions. After an early time-out asked by Brazilian coach Ze Roberto, Team USA still comfortably set the pace of the game (8 	&ndash; 3) with the same authority they had been displaying since the start of their Olympic campaign. After missing the quarterfinal against the Dominican Republic, American setter and captain Lindsey Berg was there to marshal her side with great confidence and with the Brazilian spikers that were lacking accuracy, Team USA easily and quickly raised the score up to a massive 13 &ndash; 5 lead.</p>
